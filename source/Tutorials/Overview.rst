This decision tree is meant as an overview of the available choices in the model.

By going over this tree, you come across all aspects of the model, represented by the headers of the ``.ini`` file.
If you choose to include an aspect, we advice you to check out the complete list of the options in :ref:`ini-file-label`.

For any simulation, the grid and time settings have to be specified (:ref:`Grid ``[Grid]``` and :ref:`Timeloop ``[Time]```), hence this is not included in the scheme below.
